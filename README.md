Supergotchi is a remake of the old "Tamagotchi" in Java, supporting advanced features and moving it toward a "gotchi" life simulator.

Some ideas:

The Gotchi will have a name, sex and personality traits.
The Gotchi have needs, the user is in charge of these needs in order to make the Gotchi happy.
The Gotchi has an age and can actually die. 
The Gotchi can interact with objects around his world to satisfy his needs.
NPCs gotchies will be created to interact with your Gotchi.
The Gotchi can have a home, coins and can shop for furnitures.
Statistics and personality will be saved on a JSon file.

-------------------------------------

Future ideas:

2d implementation.
Networking to interact with other players.
